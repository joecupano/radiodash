 ## Static folder

 Any additional HTML files are stored here. Any annoying thing all browsers do is look for a FAVICON.ICO
 file. The file is a small image icon that some sites host and is displayed in your browser tab with
 the title of the web page. I create done cause I go tired of seeing an error in the Browser inspect 
 console while I was building the app.

 If you want to create your own FAVICON.ICO, easiest way is from the following website that generates
 them.

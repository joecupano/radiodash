 An annoying thing all browsers do is look for a FAVICON.ICO file. The file is a small image icon
 that some sites host and is displayed in your browser tab with  the title of the web page.
 I created one cause I go tired of seeing an error in the Browser inspect console while I was
 building the app.

 If you want to create your own FAVICON.ICO, easiest way is from the following website that generates
 them.
